## Description 
On-track is a Node.js CLI application that takes in user input. Upon launching the app, users are presented with various options, including viewing all departments, roles, and employees, as well as adding new departments, roles, and employees, and updating an employee's role.

When viewing departments, a table displays the department names and ids in a formatted manner. Similarly, when viewing roles, users are shown job titles, role ids, the associated department, and salary. And when viewing employees, a formatted table presents employee ids, first and last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers.

To add a department, users enter the department name and the information is added to the database. The same goes for adding a role, where users input the role name, salary, and department, and the information is stored in the database. Lastly, when adding an employee, users enter the employee's first and last names, role, and manager and have the option to update the employee's role by selecting the employee and entering the new role. All of this information is then updated in the database.
